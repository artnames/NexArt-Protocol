# Governance

This document describes how the NexArt Protocol evolves.

---

## Current Model

The protocol is maintained under **engineering-led stewardship**.

There is no DAO.  
There is no token-based governance.  
There is no external committee.

Decisions are made by the core maintainers based on:

- Technical correctness
- Backward compatibility
- Incremental enforcement readiness
- Long-term portability

---

## Principles

### Conservative Evolution

New capabilities require new protocol versions.  
Existing schemas are not modified once frozen.  
Backward compatibility is preserved.

### Incremental Enforcement

Enforcement is rolled out mode by mode.  
Each mode progresses from experimental → soft-enforced → hard-enforced.  
No mode is hard-enforced until validation is complete.

### Explicit Non-Goals

The protocol maintains explicit boundaries.  
Features outside scope are rejected, not deferred.

---

## Future Considerations

Token-based or community governance may be considered in the future.  
No timeline or commitment exists.  
Any governance change would require a new protocol version.

## Canonical Authority

If conflicts exist between documentation sources:

1. **https://nexart.io** is authoritative for human-readable specification.
2. **https://nexart.xyz** is the reference implementation.
3. This repository is the canonical public mirror.
